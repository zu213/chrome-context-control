# Chrome context control

Basic Chrome extension project allowing users more control over Chromes right-click context menu.

#### Important note
Chrome extensions do not run on Chrome pages i.e. <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a>, <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> or <a href="chrome://newtab">chrome://newtab</a> (Links wont open if chrome isn't your default browser).

## Use



## Edting this code and using it locally
To run this code visit <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> (you have to be logged into a chrome account) and press "Load unpacked", then navigate to this repo's folder on your local device and press "select folder".

You will have to refresh any valid (as mentioned earlier) pages before being able to see the updates you've made.

## Notes about creating a chrome extension

To start devloping/using a basic chrome extension I recommend this guide here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked.

This sets up an extension where you can add something to the context menu.
